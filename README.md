**Bank Customer Churn Prediction Project**

This project is a machine learning classification project that focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will leave or stay with the bank. The dataset used for this project contains various features that provide information about the customers, such as their credit score, geographical location, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of bank products, credit card ownership, active membership status, estimated salary, and their churn or exit status.

For this project, the Random Forest Classifier algorithm was utilized as the primary model for predicting customer churn. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and provide accurate predictions.

The project involved several steps, including exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the distribution, correlations, and patterns within the data. Feature selection techniques, specifically chi-squared (ch2) and SelectKBest, were employed to identify the top 5 features that have the most significant impact on predicting customer churn.

No missing values were found in the dataset, eliminating the need for handling missing data. Additionally, feature engineering, such as creating new features or transforming existing ones, was not performed in this project.

The goal of the project was to provide the bank with a practical predictive model that could identify customers who are likely to churn or exit. By identifying such customers in advance, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering personalized incentives, implementing targeted marketing campaigns, or improving customer service.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of Random Forest classification, along with feature selection techniques, in predicting customer churn within the banking industry. It provides insights into the factors influencing customer churn and enables the bank to make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention strategies.
